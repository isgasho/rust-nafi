Nafi is a scripting language designed by @CAD97 because all languages are awful and I can do better, honestly!
Sarcasm aside, Nafi has been inspired by primarily by Rust, Kotlin, Swift, and Python, and countless other experience.

This project, `rust-nafi`, is a compiler/interpreter for the language Nafi written in Rust.

At the current time, this repository is under heavy development to produce the first working version.
It's intended to create a working version in time to [compete in a challenge][CODE REVIEW].

## Goals

- Aliasing NAND mutability brought to a more script-like environment
- Cross-platform portability to all of Rust's first-class targets

### Non-Goals

- Feature parity with Rust, Kotlin, or Swift
