Nafi is a scripting language designed by @CAD97 because all languages are awful and I can do better, honestly!
Sarcasm aside, Nafi has been inspired by primarily by Rust, Kotlin, Swift, and Python, and countless other experience.

This project, `rust-nafi`, is a compiler/interpreter for the language Nafi written in Rust.

At the current time, this repository is under heavy development to produce the first working version.
It originally was intended to [compete in a challenge][CODE REVIEW], but the deadline passed.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Nafi!
I am deeply humbled that you would consider this project worthy of your time.
See [CONTRIBUTING] for more information on contributing,
but always, feel free to submit a PR that improves something about this project!

This project is very much in a state of rapid prototyping and development currently.
Once the end-goal design becomes a bit more concrete, more documentaiton will be written.
One of the project's goals is to be a very well-documented and well-compartimentalized compiler.
If you know Rust, understanding enough of the project to contribute _should_ be easy.
If not, that's a bug in the documentation; open an issue and we'll work to improve it!
